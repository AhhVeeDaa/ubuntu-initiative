## 🏗️ NEW HOMEPAGE ARCHITECTURE

### Section Flow

```
1. Hero - Grounding Statement
   "Energy into Intelligence. Intelligence into Sovereignty."
   
2. The Stack - Visual
   River → Power → Compute → AI → Community
   
3. The Problem We Address
   • 4 bullet points, plain English
   
4. The Ubuntu AI Model
   • Contrast table (Conventional vs Ubuntu)
   
5. What Exists Today
   • 5 concrete checkpoints
   
6. What Ubuntu AI Enables
   • 6 domain cards
   
7. Governed, Not Extracted
   • 4 principles
   
8. An Invitation
   • Target audiences + CTA
   
9. Final Statement
   "This is infrastructure for the century ahead."
```

### Key Principles Applied

1. **Clarity > Poetry**
   - One-sentence definitions
   - Bullet points, not paragraphs
   - Visual hierarchy explicit

2. **Infrastructure Framing**
   - Energy → Intelligence pipeline concrete
   - Stack visualization prominent
   - Present tense throughout

3. **Trust Through Transparency**
   - "What Exists Today" section kills skepticism
   - Governance principles explicit
   - No overpromising

4. **Calm = Legitimacy**
   - Zero scroll animations
   - Locked font sizes
   - Static tables preferred
   - Consistent spacing

## 🎯 AUDIENCE FIT

### Before Transformation
❌ Ideological density prevented engagement  
❌ Unclear what exists vs. what's aspirational  
❌ Required belief to understand value  
❌ Engineers unsure of technical approach  
❌ Policymakers unclear on scope  

### After Transformation
✅ **Policymakers**: Clear scope, alignment, governance  
✅ **Engineers**: See infrastructure pathway  
✅ **Investors**: Understand value creation  
✅ **Communities**: See benefit mechanisms  
✅ **Researchers**: Identify collaboration points

## 🎨 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY SHIFT

### Old Approach
```
Vision → Philosophy → Technology → You Might Believe
```

### New Approach
```
Problem → Solution → Reality → Obvious Engagement
```

### Messaging Hierarchy

**Level 1: Infrastructure (Homepage)**
- What it is
- Why it must exist
- What exists today

**Level 2: Approach (Philosophy - Optional)**
- How it's different
- Why these choices
- Deeper principles

**Level 3: Details (Other Pages)**
- Technical specs
- Governance procedures
- Partnership opportunities

---
