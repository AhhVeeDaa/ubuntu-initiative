# 🔓 Fix: 404 Error - Authentication Protection

## Problem
The `/agents` page returns a 404 because **Vercel Authentication Protection** is enabled on your deployment.

## Solution: Disable Authentication (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Go to Protection Settings
Chrome should be open to:
https://vercel.com/avida-s-projects/ubuntu-initiative-dashboard/settings/protection

### Step 2: Disable Protection
1. Find "Vercel Authentication" or "Deployment Protection"
2. Click "Edit" or toggle it **OFF**
3. Save changes

### Step 3: Test the Page
After disabling, visit:
https://ubuntu-initiative-dashboard-eayzvrev1-avida-s-projects.vercel.app/agents

## Alternative: Keep Auth but Add Bypass

If you want to keep authentication enabled:

1. In Protection settings, get your **Bypass Token**
2. Visit:
   ```
   https://ubuntu-initiative-dashboard-eayzvrev1-avida-s-projects.vercel.app/agents?x-vercel-set-bypass-cookie=true&x-vercel-protection-bypass=YOUR_TOKEN
   ```

## Why This Happened

The authentication is a Vercel feature that protects preview/development deployments. Since this is a production deployment but you want it publicly accessible, you should disable it.

---

## After Fixing

Once authentication is disabled, your agents dashboard will be publicly accessible at:
**https://ubuntu-initiative-dashboard-eayzvrev1-avida-s-projects.vercel.app/agents**

And the API will work at:
**https://ubuntu-initiative-dashboard-eayzvrev1-avida-s-projects.vercel.app/api/agents/status**

---

✅ **The code is deployed correctly** - just need to remove the authentication barrier!
